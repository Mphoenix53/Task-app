      <p>Hello, my names Michael Phoenix, Iâ€™ve been in the trucking industry
         for the last fifteen years as a driver. Before trucking driving 
         I served in the Marine Core where I gained the skills to become one 
         of the best mop pushing, bathroom scrubbing, cleaning ninjas 
         Uncle Sam aver turned out. During my elite janitorial career 
         I also managed to find time to squeeze in being a 
         mechanic fixing tucks. Before serving, I grew up in a small town 
         in the foothills of California. Whair I and enjoy mountain biking, 
         motorcycle racing and hiking through the back country.</p>
